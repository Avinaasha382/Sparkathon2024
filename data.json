                "text": "I bought TCL 55\" Class 4-Series 4K UHD HDR Smart Roku TV - 55S451 to replace a 5 year old model HiSense 55\" 4K TV.  \n\nPICTURE QUALITY\nWhile the picture brightness isn't quite as bright as what I'm used to, the image quality is outstanding for the price.  TCL team if you are reading this, you will need to improve in this area to stay competitive with other manufacturers.\n\nTo maximize the picture quality, here are the settings that I used. \n1. TV Brightness = \"Brighter\"\n2. Picture Mode = \"Vivid\"\n3. Customize Picture > Back Light = \"100\"\n4. Customize Picture > Brightness = \"50\"\n5. Customize Picture > Contrast = \"100\"\n6. Customize Picture > Sharpness = \"50\"\n7. Customize Picture > Color = \"60\"\n8. Expert Settings > Dynamic Contrast = \"High\"\n9. Expert Settings > Gamma Correction = \"2.4\"\n10. Expert Settings > Noise Reduction = \"High\"\n11. Expert Settings > Color Temperature = \"Cool\"\n12. Expert Settings > Color Space = Default Setting\n13. Expert Settings > Auto Setting = \"Standard\"\n\nOverall, I would say the whites in the picture are good but not great.  This would improve if the nit brightness were increased. The black colors with the adjustments above are very good.  \n\nSOUND QUALITY\nSound quality of the speakers is good for this TV.  Although I would like to see a menu option to change the Equalizer settings to adjust highs, mids, and lows.  This is especially important when adding a sound bar or external speakers. \n\nWALL MOUNTING\nWall mounting was straight forward.  TCL provided screws in the top two holes for wall mounting, however the bottom two holes are empty and you will need to bring your own hardware.  Not much of an issue there, however the mounting holes are a tad bit too low for my existing wall mount bracket setup.  Not all manufacturers have the same spacing design which is understandable; although, this design can be slightly improved. \n\nCONCLUSION\nI would gjve this TV an 8.5 out of 10 based on the value and overall quality of this model. \n\nGreat job TCL team!",

For those who want to know the measurements so that you know what size tv stand you can use, my stand is 40\" wide. I took the off chance and tried it and it worked. The legs measure 38\" across and 9.5\" deep so I have and inch on each side left until I decide to get another stand in the future. The screen itself is 44' across, 23.5\" tall (28\" tall from the legs to the top of the screen) and about 50.5\" diagonal.  I hope this helps many of you with those questions. I really like this tv and hope you enjoy the picture and sound quality that I have come to know with mine.",

The fabric and the wood is beautiful and feels like good quality. It took about 20 minutes to assemble each chair. The longest part was simply getting the padding off each piece. They were packaged wonderfully. The biggest con that makes these 4 start for me is that they are very firm and there isn't much padding in the back. I added a pillow to it for now for comfort and might add a better lumbar pillow. The pillows that came with them were awkwardly small. Overall these are very stylish, affordable chairs that I won't mind my dog and kids living in.",

However, all 3 chairs I received came with bolts that were too short to use. I had to go to a hardware store to buy longer ones which was a huge hassle. Then when the other chair arrived, we realized if you switch the right and left legs, the bolts they give you will work (for some reason the holes in the legs are different girths depending on which side you put them in from). However, that chair also had the holes in the cushions misaligned so it took two people to fit everything together. But that's what you get when you buy such a cheap chair. Because it's so cheap I was worried it would be uncomfortable\u2014however the seat cushion is comfy! The back cushion is kind of stiff but with a pillow it's fine. The photo in the ad makes it look slightly darker green and kind of suede/soft but it's really linen and almost like a soft denim type material.",

Burgers, hotdogs, chicken, sausage, and some steaks. Its small but grill is enough to cook decent amount on. I got this for my husband and thought oh man is this gonna be a dud. Well surprise it wasnt. He loved it an couldnt believe only paid couple bucks shy of a \ud83d\udcaf. Grant you its not like the big silver grills you ory are used to seeing, but i like it. compact enough and lightweight. We've had it on the back porch and front. Now I know we couldnt of done that with the bigger grills. Also even fully assembled can fit into the back of my vehicle. I have Jeep liberty if that helps with the sizing of it. So if we want to take to his parents or even camping so be it. So if ya want something small thats not going to take up limited space on your porch this is it. You can do everything on it that you can do on a bigger grill. we had on it at the same time 12 burgers 8 sausages and set a whole package of dogs on it. So If you need to grill more than that at a time maybe its not the grill for you. But for my family of four its a win. Plus I'm not heating up my kitchen an get to enjoy my husband to cook on it. When they say looks are deceiving well its true with this. Looks like something small an flimsy but very sturdy. I like the hooks to keep the utensils on and the sides you can put your platters on and it stays. So I guess win for me. I know they say bigger is better but not in this case. I'm happy with the purchase and glad I followed through an got it. We have been cooking on it a lot. It doesnt come with a tank so I had one an went an got it filled. So if you have one it cost me like 15 bucks to get it filled. So thats the only thing extra I had get. But I see tanks all over now at gas stations not sure how much. Oh when we hooked it up I thought wed have to light it because of the chain thats with it. But no you turn the knobs and it clicks an starts. So thats another good thing. Hope this helps with your decision on buying. Hope you enjoy the grill an get to bbq and enjoy. Dont mind the mess we've been outside an grillin a lot since I purchased this. \ud83d\ude01\u270c\ufe0f",

You can do everything on it that you can do on a bigger grill. we had on it at the same time 12 burgers 8 sausages and set a whole package of dogs on it. So If you need to grill more than that at a time maybe its not the grill for you. But for my family of four its a win. Plus I'm not heating up my kitchen an get to enjoy my husband to cook on it. When they say looks are deceiving well its true with this. Looks like something small an flimsy but very sturdy. I like the hooks to keep the utensils on and the sides you can put your platters on and it stays. So I guess win for me. I know they say bigger is better but not in this case. I'm happy with the purchase and glad I followed through an got it. We have been cooking on it a lot. It doesnt come with a tank so I had one an went an got it filled. So if you have one it cost me like 15 bucks to get it filled. So thats the only thing extra I had get. But I see tanks all over now at gas stations not sure how much. Oh when we hooked it up I thought wed have to light it because of the chain thats with it. But no you turn the knobs and it clicks an starts. So thats another good thing. Hope this helps with your decision on buying. Hope you enjoy the grill an get to bbq and enjoy. Dont mind the mess we've been outside an grillin a lot since I purchased this. \ud83d\ude01\u270c\ufe0f",

I made sure to season my grill with Pam spray so the paint wouldn't bubble and peel. I made sure to let the coals white over before closing the lid... to prevent it from over heating. It worked great... everything I wanted in a charcoal grill! I had the hardest time making the decision to purchase due to mixed reviews. But I kept telling myself some ppl just don't follow directions well and I believed in my abilities to figure out a solution to each negative review. Please purchase the grill if you are interested because you'd be glad that you did. And YouTube the reservations you may have it's plenty of videos to help you through.",

There is room for all the regular refrigerator foods and many bottles and cans of liquids.  We plugged it up with a surge protector, of course.  I hope this little bugger lasts a very long time.

My recommendation unless you have a truck capable of transporting the freezer is to contact Galanz direct as soon as you receive the fridge if it is damaged on delivery. while they have a year warranty you only have a month of full service warranty to claim damages done in shipping",

I'm super happy I got it on sale for about $200 with 3 year warranty; knowing that these things full price were $550 with no warranty. I see many people put low star review ratings due to issues with fedex as the shipping company that deals with the frieght. I took the risk and it arrived in perfect condition with no dents or broken items inside the refrigerator. I recommend the item but I warn everyone that it is a lottery ordering one online and delivered to the home and out of walmarts control whether the fridge arrives in perfect condition or not. The only thing I dont like about the fridge is the bulb temperature color which is yellow as I prefer a crisp white but I won't reduce my rating over something I can easily replace myself. I live on the second floor and they put a bedframe outside my door but left the fridge at the bottom of the stairs lol again nothing against walmart and nothing against fedex. It is heavy and unsafe for someone to carry it up stairs by yourself. Its bulky and awkward to carry up by yourself. Also you must wait at least 24 hours before you plug into the wall as the fridge needs to be upright for that amount of time to have the refrigerant and compressor oils settle back down",

The front of the fridge door has a deep dent in it directly front and center, and a crease in the stainless steel as if it were hit and then forcefully pushed. Again, couldn't tell from the box. I feel like these sat in the warehouse for quite some time as the plastic sticky wrap to protect it from scratches was nearly melded to the outside and very difficult to remove, which would explain the deep discount. our fridge went down and we needed something this size asap and this was the best deal with a 3 day wait time for delivery. After unboxing it and finding all this, with the return policy, I assume it is non returnable anyway. Glad we got it on sale at the very least. With the other reviews, I feel like these should be listed as scratch and dent. Anyway, just a heads up if you're considering it. Plugged it in, stated getting cold right away, so that is good.",

I was going to order an Asus with the same specs but as soon as I ordered the Asus the local store said it was out of stock.  So i bought this so I could get it the same day.  I was hesitant because I had bought two previous HP laptops; one I had to send in for warranty repair and that issue kept coming back and the other had a battery issue where the battery just went off a cliff after a less than a year.  This works ok for my needs but two things really stand out as a negative.  It took forever to make a back up drive of windows 11, it literally took the battery down to 20 percent or so because it took a few hours to complete.  I then wiped windows off the drive and installed linux mint.  And the battery is still bad.  I am regretting not getting the Asus now.   I will say the wi fi and hardware work well other than the battery.  I am able to play some lower demand games and older games on steam such as two point campus and planet zoo well.  I also don't have any issues with having ten or so tabs open on palemoon web broswer.  I don't really use the webcam so I havent tried anything with the cam.  I think the speaker(s) work well but I know some people are snobs about that.  Demanding the best on the cheaper products.  Having used this a few days, I wish I would have waited for the Asus laptop to ship instead of buying this laptop.    If your happy with HP/an HP fan, i would recommend this laptop for users who want to use this in a home office or for home schooling or for playing moderate to lower end games in a place they can plus it in.  Wont run the latest greatest games but most people would find this good for games they play.  I would not recommend for anyone wanting a laptop they can use all day without a charge.",

Sadly, it comes with Mcafee security software hidden in the computer. I have used Zonealarm for many years and wanted to stick with one company. I used Win 11 to uninstall the software so that I could install the Zonealarm that I just purchased. The software would not install because Mcgreedy reinstalled its own software again but hide the software from the Win 11 uninstall feature. I returned the Zonealarm software that I just purchased and now I hope for a refund. I needed new security software, so I purchased Norton. The same thing happened when I tried to install it, security software is installed, and I still can't find it to use Win 11 to uninstall it. Luckily, Norton has a Feret program that finds the old software and creates a simple button to start the uninstall process. The Norton software was successfully installed. Other than the incredibly annoying, deceitful Mcgreedy security software, the computer works nice. I won't be using it with battery power so I can't comment on battery life. I use the HDMI to power a monitor and it works just fine. It took hours to copy the OS to the recovery drive, so be patient, hours. The input pad is like most others, clumsy, but the switch underneath works very well, a nice \"click\" when depressed. I would buy again but it has been less than a week and the durability has not been tested. Seems solid enough.",

In 2 months, I've taken this Chromebook to class, lab, work, coffee shops and even on a cruise so I could use it to study for a midterm. It is so convenient and fits in my purse! It connects to the internet very fast and I love that all my google apps are so easily accessible. My favorite app is the cursive app which makes all my notes super easy to write and accessible from anywhere that I can log in to my google drive. The stylus that it comes with is pretty thin and lightweight so I was skeptical, but it was still comfortable to hold and write with. I love using it to study flashcards because I could download the Quizlet app on it. If you're switching between this and a full size laptop or desktop computer, the keyboard is smaller and does not have all keys (like caps lock for example) so it would be an adjustment. But when I'm home I like using this to watch lecture videos (the display quality and sound is great) and using a full size laptop to type notes or an assignment. It charges very fast with USB-C and stays charged for a long time compared to my laptop. I can see the felt-like magnetic stand attachment and keyboard getting dirty after a while but that's pretty much the only con. I wouldn't use this to do any big projects or papers on, but for everything else - this is my go to.",

In my short time with the Chromebook, the keyboard reminded me of a flimsy surface keyboard. The keyboard only lays flat and not on an angle. The ergonomics will drive any user crazy. I'd avoid this product and get a Windows ARM laptop instead.",

                "text": "The iPhone 15 pro came out in September 2023, and many other devices were released in 2023, also including new software updates. The iPhone 15 pro is supposed to have a longer battery life, a new USB-C charger that charges faster than the previous chargers, and a new action button. The iPhone 15 costs $999 with 128GB, and with TB it is $1499.\nI had the iPhone 12 for about 3 years, and I noticed that it was time to upgrade my phone since my iPhone 12 was slow and lacked many of the newer updates. I upgrade my phone in late November or early December. The phone took a little longer than two weeks to arrive. When I finally got my phone and used it I immediately realized how much longer the battery life lasted, when I had the iPhone 12 I barely could make it through the day without it dying, but with the iPhone 15 pro, it lasts the entire day of school even with me being on it constantly. I also had the realization that it charged faster than my last and had a better reaction time when clicking or swiping out of tabs. However, the price of the phone is very pricey. I believe if you are looking to upgrade the iPhone 15 pro is great and I would rate a 5 if the price was more affordable but since it is not I believe it is a 4.5 stars overall. I would recommend you get the iPhone 15 pro.",
